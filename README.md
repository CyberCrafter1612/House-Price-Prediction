# House-Price-Prediction
The House Price Prediction project uses machine learning to estimate housing prices based on multiple features such as location, lot size, year built, number of bedrooms, and other property characteristics. The project involves data collection, preprocessing (cleaning and feature engineering), exploratory data analysis, and building regression models like XGBoost or Random Forest to achieve accurate price estimates. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The predictive model helps stakeholders make informed decisions in real estate by forecasting house prices with minimal error.

Key aspects include:
Data visualization and correlation analysis for feature insights
Train-test split for validating model accuracy
Use of advanced regression algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest)
Graphical comparison of actual vs. predicted prices through scatter plots
Practical use in real estate market analysis and investment decisions

# üè† House Value Predictor - Machine Learning Project

## üìå Overview
This project predicts the selling price of houses based on various features like location, area, number of rooms, and other attributes.  
The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and forecast prices for new properties.

## üóÇ Project Structure
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` ‚Äî Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `house_price_prediction.py` ‚Äî Python script version of the workflow.
- `data/house_data.csv` ‚Äî Dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/house_model.pkl` ‚Äî Saved trained model.
- `images/` ‚Äî Visualizations like predicted vs actual prices and feature importance.
